# Hi, I'm Muhammad Waqas Saleem 👋

### Energy and Environmental Engineer | Decarbonization | Sustainability

I began my journey in traditional hydrocarbon engineering as a petroleum engineer, gaining insight into large-scale energy systems. Motivated to contribute to climate solutions, I shifted toward **energy transition** and **low-carbon solutions**. My team and I presented decarbonization strategies for the oil and gas industry at **ADIPEC 2019**, securing 3rd place among 19 international teams.

I joined the **Erasmus Mundus program (ME3+)** with a fully funded scholarship, completing a double master's in **Energy Engineering and Environmental Management** across Hungary, Italy, and France. During this time, I interned at **Air Liquide**, applying sustainability and environmental engineering principles in an industrial setting.

My work combines **engineering fundamentals**, **environmental analysis**, **life cycle thinking**, **carbon footprint modeling**, and **programming** to support energy transition, decarbonization, and low-carbon solutions. These experiences have shaped me into an **open-minded professional**, fostering teamwork and adaptability in multidisciplinary environments.

Beyond work, I enjoy **graphic design** and **playing badminton**. Check out my graphic design portfolio here: [Portfolio](https://waqassaleem1304.wixsite.com/website)
